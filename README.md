# EyeInside
An Image Search Engine based on YOLO.

**PLANNED ISSUES**  

-YOLO model has 7 classes right now. It will be rearranged. COCO and ImageNet datasets will be added (at least I plan to do it)  
-SpaCy needs to be retrained.  
-GUI will be developed. Images which have detected objects will be shown on the GUI.  

I am still developing this project. Even YOLO and SpaCy models are needed to train better, the SpaCy-based NLP model can get your query and then YOLO model can detect what you search for. 
This GitHub repository is being updated day by day. Stay tuned.
